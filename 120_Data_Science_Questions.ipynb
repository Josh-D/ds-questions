As Peter Mills mentions in his excellent answer, switching from mean squared error to mean absolute difference (or something like Huber Loss) reduces the influence of outliers. I explain a bit about why this is the case at Why is the median a measure of central tendency?\n",
    "* Use different metric (example: median instead of mean, absolute deviation instead of standard deviation): this method is mostly applied when outliers probably distort the distribution.\n",
    "* Opt for confidence interval: usually 3~5 times of standard deviation, the outside are probably outlier, but this method work fines with Gaussian-like distribution (normal, student,...)\n",
    "* Use transformation: if outlier is an inseparable part of your data set, it is okay to use log or more robust transformation.\n",
